##### How to play!

1. I have not uploaded my `credentials.json` file to the github. So if you want to run the app, you should be copying & pasting your own credentials.json file here - `storage/credentials.json`.
2. I have added one env value - `SPREADSHEET_ID`, so you need to set it up if you want to play with your own spread sheet.
